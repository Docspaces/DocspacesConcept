# Docspaces Personal - Proof Of Concept

This is a playground project for trying a few things out. It is a small node express app for creating Mermaid diagrams -- we'll soon add Draw.io and BPMN.io documents too.

This version is very rough and ready. We're trying not to use any frameworks, so it's plain HTML, plain CSS, plain JS. We're loading Mermaid and Monaco editor from CDN (so we don't even need webpacker or the like).
